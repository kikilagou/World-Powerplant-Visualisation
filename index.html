							Two tools were used for identifying and dealing with blank rows in the dataset. Firstly,
							when the dataset was analysed using CSVLint, several minor issues were identified,
							predominantly, empty lines in the dataset (54 empty rows).
							Removing blank rows in the dataset was done using OpenRefine. OpenRefine offers a variety of
							import options, one of which is "Store Blank Rows". This option for keeping blank rows in
							the dataset was unselected, meaing OpenRefine automatically deleted any completely empty
							lines as the data was imported.
							The removal of the rows could be verified by running the newly created dataset from
							OpenRefine through CSVLint again. However, an easier way to check if the relevant rows were
							deleted was to check the row count in OpenRefine, which went from 5016 to 4962.

						<div class="card-body">
							There were several spelling mistakes in the data that were fixed in OpenRefine using the
							clustering tool on the effected columns. Clustering was carried out over entire columns by
							selecting the column then choosing 'Edit cells' > 'Cluster and edit'. After reviewing a
							merge was carried out over the clustered groups using the spelling of the most popoular
							option in that particular cluster.
							There were some instances where there were multiple variations of certain words or cell
							values, for example two different cells had the same power plant name but different
							capitalisations, resulting in musltiple representaions of the same category.
							Another example was in the 'country' column there were mutliple variants for the United
							Kingdom country code, such as GBR, UK, London, which all indicated a UK country code.
							As before this issue was addressed by utilising OpenRefine's cluster and mergin tool. Every
							column was individually checked but going to 'Edit cells' > 'Cluster and edit'. The clusters
							were reviewed and if deemed to represent the same category were merged under the set's most
							popular category name.

							In order to identify duplicate rows a column that contained uniquely identifying data had to

							To identify any existing duplicate rows a text facet was applied to this column. Any
							identifiers used in more than one row could then be easily filtered out. The duplicate rows

							In several of the numerica columns in the dataset, the number of decimal places was not

							in the 'commissioning_year' column, some years had a demical place, possibly to indicate a
							month or part of the year. These decimal places were removed from the year values).
							Examples of inconsistend decimal places were found in the 'longitude', 'latitude',
							'estimated_generation_gwh', and several other numeric columns. The way this issues was fixed
							was by opening the dataset in Excel. Then for the affected column, selecting all the data in
							the column, right clicking and going to 'Formal Cells' > 'Number' and setting the decimal

						<div class="card-body">
							There were some values which were obviously outliers and not representations of true data.
							For example in the 'commissioning_year' column some of the years included '15123', in this
							case this data was assumed to completely unreasonable, and the row was discarded from the
							dataset.
							In other cases the issue was mroe subtle, for example, there were values for the
							'commissioning_year' of '200'. This value was assumed to represent years in the 2000s,
							perhaps used to indicate a span of multiple years in the decade.
							Due to the fact that it could not possibly be infered which particular year these values
							refered to, and becuase there were only a couple of instances of this issue, the rows were
							deleted from the dataset.
							Another case where data in a column was not correct, was in the 'country_long' column where
							descriptors of the data were included rather than only the relevant data. An example was
							'Vietnam', which contained some entries with 'Noth' or 'South' prepended to the name. These
							were fixed by removing the extra data.

							OpenRefine or Excel. I chose to fix the issue in OpenRefine. The method was to manual select
							groups of special characters in a column, then go to the heading of the column > 'Edit
							cells' > 'Replace'. Then in the 'Find' field, the special characters were inputed. In the
							'Replace with' field, nothing was imputed, so that the unwated characters would effectively
							be deleted. This was repeated for each column that contained special characters. This

							Some numerical values were unrealistic and had to be removed from the dataset altogether.
							There were a very small number of cells affected by this issue, and it was observed in the
							'estimated_generation_gwh' field. The 'reasonable' range of values for this column seemed to
							be between 0 and (apprx) 45000. Rows that contained values such as 9679957979999.00,
							45745747457457400.00, 45745457.00, and 346346436.00 were removed from the dataset. There
							only four rows removed for this reason. This was done using Excel, as it is difficult to
							remove rows in OpenRefine. The exreme values problem was first discovered in OpenRefine when
							a numerical facet was placed on 'estimated_generation_gwh'. The spread of the data was
							screwered, which promted further investigation. In order to identify cells with extreme
							values, a filter was applied to every column in the dataset by going to 'Home' > 'Sort and
							Filter' > 'Filter'. Then the numerical columns were checked using the filter. As Excel's
							filtering tool sorts the unique values by ascending order, it was easy to identify extremely
							small or extremely large values that did not fall within the correct range for the column.

					<div id="collapse4" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#accordionExample2">
						<div class="card-body">
							Some cells in the dataset were in the wrong place, shifted either one column to the left or
							right. The right shifting of the data was due to the 'country_long' value being repeated in
							the column next to it. This right shift also resulted in an extra column on the end of the
							dataset.
							The left shifted cells were due to missing data, for example some rows were missing
							'country_long' values, and instead in their place were 'gppd_idnr' values.
							The incorrect data positions were identified primarily through visually examining the
							dataset, and noticing that some values, such 'gppd_idnr' codes were in the wrong column, and
							that some other values such as 'country_long' were repeated in the row. Futermore, in Excel,
							when applying a filter to the entire dataset, a filter was set on a column with no header on
							the very end of the dataset, indicating that the column contained data which was not meant
							to be there, or accoutned for.
							In order to fix the right shifted cells, a filter was applied in Excel to the extra column
							with no header on the end of the dataset. Then selecting the non blank rows it was easy to
							identify what parts of the data needd to be shifted to the left by one column. The repeated
							data in previous columns was deleted and the relevant data was copied and pasted into its
							correct positioning.
							To fix the left shifted cells in the dataset, the easiest way was to examine the very last
							column of the dataset, 'estimated_generation_gwh'. Using a filter in Excel, the empty rows
							in this column were selected. First, it was visually verified that the selected rows were
							left shifted. Then the filtered rows were copied and pasted into their correct positioning.

							Some columns contained data that did follow the same formatting and naming conventions as
							the rest of the column. For example, there were some entries in the 'country' column which
							were not in the form of a country code, instead they were full country names (one particular
							example was 'Spain' being used a country code), or more subtly some country codes did not
							follow the three letter format that was prevalent in the column.
							A numerical example of this issue was found in the 'estimated_generation_gwh' column where
							most values were digits, however some cells included the letters '(gwh)', which in this
							context represented the units of the numbers in the column.
							Data such as this needed to be unified such that there were not multiple representations of
							the same entity.
							In order to standardise data which did not follow the conventions of the collumn, text
							facets were predominantly used. For example, in order to check that every code in the
							'country' column correstponded to a unique 'country_long' name, text facets were applied to
							both columns. Then I manually checked through each country code by clicking on it in the
							facet, in the 'country_long' text facet the corresponding coutnry name was displayed, if
							there was ever more than one country name for a single country code (or multiple country
							names for a particular country code) then these were fixed to have a one-to-one mapping.

							It was difficult to decide how to deal with the blank cells int he dataset. In some cases
							data imputation was logical and appropriate. For example, in the 'country_long' column, some
							cells were blank, however the country name could be infered from the country code column,
							and such data was imputed in the dataset. When multiple cells could have the same value the
							option to 'Apply to all identical cells' was used in OpenRefine.
							In other cases, data could not be imputed without using external resources. For this project
							no external data resources were used to impute data into the dataset. Blank cells were left
							blank, and any cells that contained values such as 'NaN', or 'null' were change to be
							completely blank, such that the blank cells in the dataset were standardised.
							Ever though almost every row contained some blanks cells, this did not take away from the
							data for the most part. It would have been inappropriate to remove cells with blank values.
							There were some instances were missing data meant the particular row was excluded from the
							dataset. For example missing 'longitude' and 'latitude' values resulted in the row not being
							considered in some visualisations.

					<h5>Target Audience and Data</h5>

					<p>This visualisation was intended for an audience interested in gaining a high level overview of
						the distribution of power plants in the world.
						A colour scheme is apploed to the visualisation to allow the audience to immediately see
						information regarding locations of power plants that primarily produce renewable and
						non-renewable energy.
						Thus the visualisation addresses two main audience interests - seeing locations of power plants,
						and the environmental impact that various countries have based on their power plants.

						The data that was utilised for this visualisation included the power plant name and owner
						information, the year in which the site was built as well as the country, the estimated
						generated power in gigawatt hours, the various fuel types that is produces.
						Overall it combines various attributed of the dataset to give a high level overview of the data.
						The dataset does not cover certain areas of the world, such as North America, France, and
						Brazil. This is due to there being no data for these countries to plot. Due to this, the
						visualisation cannot provide full infomation regarding the world's power plants, and may not be
						the best tool for companies or proffesionals.

					</p>

					<h5>Interactivity</h5>
					<p>
						<b><u>Filtering by Fuel Category</u></b><br>
						Firstly, the user is able to filter which power plants are shown on the map by three checkboxes
						with options to view 'Renewable', 'Non-Renewable', and 'Other' power plants.
						Checking the box will show the locations of the specified category of power plants on the map,
						and unchecking hides the locations. Any combination of categories can be selected using the
						checkboxes.

						<br><b><u>Sizing by Location or Power Production</u></b><br>
						The visualisation allows for the toggling between sizing the points representing power station
						locations with a fixed size radius, and the representing the locations of power stations with a
						radius proportional to the estimated annual power generation.
						The radio buttons 'By Energy Production (GWH)' and 'By Power Plant Location' allow the user to
						switch the way points on the maps are sized.
						This option is quite useful is gaining a deeper understnading of what environmental impact power
						stations have. For example, when viewing the power station locations with fixed size points, it
						can be seen that the majority of power stations fall under the 'Renewable' energy category.
						This may lead to the assumption that the majority of power is being produced using renewable
						energy. However, this is incorrect and can be seen when the visualisation is toggled to show
						power station locations with points that are proportional in size to the energy they produce.
						In this view, it is obvious that 'Non-Renewable' power stations are responsible for producing
						the majority of power in world. It can be seen that there are only a few large 'Reneable' power
						stations that produce substancial electricity (Brazil containing the most prevalent).

						<br><b><u>Zooming</u></b><br>
						The visualisation is zoomable either by using the mouse or touchpad scroll wheel, or the user is
						able to click on the country they would like to zoom into and the visualisation will
						automatically zoom to focus on the selected area of the map. Clicking on the selected area a
						second time will pan out the visualisation to original zoom size.
						When zooming the points of the map scale accordingly allowing the power station locations to be
						viewed more easily.
