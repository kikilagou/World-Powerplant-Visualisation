======== How to Run the Visualisation ========
==============================================

Option 1 (Recommended): 

The visualiation is being hosted on GitHub. 
To access the visualisation navigate to the following URL:  https://kikilagou.github.io/World-Powerplant-Visualisation/
(Chrome was used to test the website, however other browsers should display content the same)

Option 2 (Running locally):
To host the visualisation on your local machine, spin up a local server 
    * Open linux based command prompt > navigate to directory containing index.html > run command "python -m http.server 3000"
    * Python must be installed 
Then open a web browser and type the following into the url bar: "http://localhost:3000/"
